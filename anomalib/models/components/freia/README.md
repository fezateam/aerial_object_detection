## FrEIA
This sub-package contains freia packages to use within flow-based algorithms such as Cflow.

## Description
[FrEIA](https://github.com/VLL-HD/FrEIA) package is currently not available in pypi to install via pip. The only way to install it is `pip install git+https://github.com/VLL-HD/FrEIA.git`. PyPI, however, does not support installing packages from git links. Due to this limitation, anomalib cannot be updated on PyPI. To avoid this, `anomalib` contains some of the [FrEIA](https://github.com/VLL-HD/FrEIA) modules to facilitate CFlow training/inference.
